# N8N Standard
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Docker Compose configuration file for deploying n8n with a PostgreSQL database.
# This file defines two services: 'postgres' for the database and 'n8n' for the automation application.
# It also uses Docker volumes to ensure data persistence.

services:
  postgres:
    # Uses the official PostgreSQL version 17 image, based on Alpine Linux for a smaller size.
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    # Restart policy: the container will restart automatically unless it is manually stopped.
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Environment variables for database configuration.
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}          # Username for the database.
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}  # Password for the user.
      - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}              # Name of the database to be created.
    # Volume for PostgreSQL data persistence.
    # 'postgres_data' is a named volume managed by Docker, mapped to the PostgreSQL data directory in the container.
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    # Healthcheck to ensure the database is ready to accept connections.
    healthcheck:
      # Command to check if the PostgreSQL server is ready.
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB}"]
      # Grace period at container startup before healthcheck failures are counted.
      start_period: 30s
      # Interval between each check.
      interval: 10s
      # Maximum time allowed for the check command to run.
      timeout: 5s
      # Number of unsuccessful attempts before marking the container as 'unhealthy'.
      retries: 5

  # Service for the n8n application
  n8n:
    # Uses a specific version of the n8n image to ensure stability.
    image: n8nio/n8n:1.117.3
    # Restart policy: the container will restart automatically unless it is manually stopped.
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Makes the startup of n8n dependent on the health status of PostgreSQL.
    # n8n will only start once the 'postgres' healthcheck is successful.
