# N8N Queue Mode with Redis
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Docker Compose configuration for n8n in queue mode with Redis message broker.
# This setup includes: PostgreSQL database, Redis, main n8n instance, and worker instances.
# Queue mode provides better scalability for high-volume workflow executions.

services:
  # PostgreSQL Database Service

    # Uses the official PostgreSQL version 17 image, based on Alpine Linux for a smaller size.
