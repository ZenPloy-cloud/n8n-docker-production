# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PRODUCTION DOCKER COMPOSE FOR n8n (MAIN MODE)
# TARGET HARDWARE: 2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# PHILOSOPHY:
# 1. SINGLE INSTANCE MODE: With 2 vCPUs, a single n8n instance is still efficient
#    and simpler than 'queue' mode. This file uses a single n8n container that
#    handles everything. For higher loads, consider the queue mode configuration instead.
# 2. STRICT RESOURCE LIMITS: CPU and RAM are explicitly divided between n8n and
#    PostgreSQL. This is a critical stability feature to prevent one service from
#    starving the other under load.
# 3. CONTROLLED CONCURRENCY: A hard limit on parallel workflow executions is set to
#    prevent CPU overload while maximizing throughput on dual-core systems.
# 4. TASK RUNNERS (INTERNAL): Task runners are enabled in internal mode for secure
#    Code node execution without the overhead of additional containers.
